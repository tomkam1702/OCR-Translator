## Overview

OCR Translator is a powerful desktop application that automatically captures text from any area of your screen, performs optical character recognition (OCR), and translates the text in real-time. It creates floating overlay windows that can be positioned anywhere on your screen, making it perfect for translating games, videos, PDFs, or any application with text that you can't easily copy and paste.

This project was inspired by a family member who was learning French by playing games with French subtitles and needed real-time translation. I hope it will be useful both for gamers and non-gamers alike for casual on-screen translations, whether you're learning a new language through entertainment or simply need to understand content in a foreign language.

This application was developed or rather vibe-coded with the support of the following AI models: Claude¬†3.7¬†Sonnet, Claude¬†Sonnet¬†4 and Gemini¬†2.5¬†Pro.
