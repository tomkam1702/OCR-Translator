## Overview

OCR Translator is a powerful desktop application that automatically captures text from any area of your screen, performs optical character recognition (OCR), and translates the text in real-time. It creates floating overlay windows that can be positioned anywhere on your screen, making it perfect for translating games, videos, PDFs, or any application with text that you can't easily copy and paste.

This project was inspired by a family member who was learning French by playing games with French subtitles and needed real-time translation. I hope it will be useful both for gamers and non-gamers alike for casual on-screen translations, whether you're learning a new language through entertainment or simply need to understand content in a foreign language.

This application was developed or rather vibe-coded with the support of Claude 3.7 AI model.

## Key Features

- **Multilingual User Interface**: Full support for English and Polish interface languages
- **Floating Overlays**: Translucent, movable windows that stay on top of other applications
- **Customizable Appearance**: Adjust colours, fonts, and transparency
- **Image Preprocessing**: Various modes to improve OCR accuracy
- **Hotkey Support**: Control the application without switching windows
- **Translation Caching**: Reduce API calls and improve performance
- **Polish Language Support**: Proper alphabetical sorting and language selection for Polish users
- **Improved Organization**: All configuration files and language resources are now organized in the `resources/` directory for better structure and maintainability
